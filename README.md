Women Techmakers Tucson Hackathon 2017

The Women Techmakers Tucson Hackathon is the first (and only at the moment!) women's-only hackathon in the Southwest. The inaugural WTM Tucson Hackathon was in 2015, and now that we have two years under our belt, we decided to switch things up this year. We decided that it's not only timely, but urgent to extend the invite to participants of all gender identities--it's all hands on deck when it comes to promoting gender parity across tech and innovation spaces. Last year we welcomed 113 participants--this year we're aiming for 200 participants! Want to know a bit more about this event? Here's the 2016 website: http://womentechmakerstucson.weebly.com/

Have you planned a hackathon centered on gender parity in tech? No? Perhaps have some ideas on how to best design an inclusive, safe, but empowered hackathon event? We welcome your ideas! We are in the early stages of planning and would love to invite your feedback, insights, ideas, and (of course!) would love to talk about your interest in attending and/or faciliitating a workshop and/or keynote-ing the event. :) Also, please feel welcome to slice, dice, and adapt this event model if you'd like. We'd be happy to support and help with the development/planning of your event too.

On the planning "To-Do" List:
<br>-Migrate the 2016 site to a Google site (for collaborative editing)
<br>-Decided on the new 9 workshops for the event (we've had 3 tracks in the past: coding, profesh development, and rapid prototyping... oh, and special topics workshop on building drones)
<br>-Figure out ways/activities to better scaffold design sprinting for project ideas before the hackathon
<br>-Code of conduct
<br>-Overall best practices/ strategies to promote team work and project management among folks that don't know each other
<br>-Sponsor ideas
<br>-Keynote ideas
<br>-Pre/post event evaluations
<br>-Marketing
<br>-... any other awesome you'd like to share!
