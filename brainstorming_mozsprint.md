## Women Techmakers Hackathon 

#### Context: 
Women Techmakers Hackathon arose out of the noticable discrepency between the number of women at hackathons versus the number of men (typically ~10% or less of participants are women). Thus the Women Techmakers Hackathon is a women only hackathon to cultivate, encourage, educate, and impower women in tech!  

- 2015 - 53 attendees
- 2016 - 113 attendees 
- 2017 - aiming for ~200 attendees 

#### 2017 Goals:
* In previous years, only women were allowed at the hackathon.
* New model: try reaching out to different groups (e.g. LGBT, minorities in CS, etc.) while still being women-centered. Participants from previous years said that the "women only" aspect of the hackathon was very important to them. But we also don't want want to isolate other minorities in coding as well. We want to be inclusive! How can we balance this? 

#### Brainstorming:
* Target audience?
   - Mostly women
   - But others welcome who are supportive of women in STEM!
* What is the focus?
   - Women-focused participants AND/OR 
   - Women-focused challenges at the hackathon. 
* Introduce different themes:
   - Projects for supporting women in STEM
   - Projects that typically occur at all Hackathons 
   - Let people know that they can compete for prizes, or they can opt out
      - But still have everyone talk about their work.  
* As facilitators, we need some type of guide to help us facilitate so it feels like a safe space. 
   - Telling people expectations. 
   - How many facilitators do we need? 
   - Typical group size = 3-4 people, so ? facilitators for ? groups. 
   - Perhaps have a facilitator in every corner of the room?
   - Also have guildeline worksheets on the table so everyone can participate, and not necessarily waiting on a facilitator! (self-paced!) (idea from "Technology Test Kitchen")
* How about having men there?
   - Make a Code of Conduct? 
   - Men also need to learn about and become aware of women's experience in tech (implicit bias, etc).
* How to incentivize people to come back the second day?
   - Split up the workshops?


#### Event planning logistics:
* Put past year's projects on the website
* Get some blurbs from past year's participants -- people who thought they might not have belonged at a hackathon, but then came and had a good experience!! 
* The collaborative classroom - Will it be okay for 200-ish people? Noise? Space?
  - Have breakout sessions in other rooms, otherwise its too loud!
  - Most rooms we'll need are currently reserved, but we can go ahead and reserve some other rooms as well. 
  - Childcare room. 
* Marketing:
  - Talk to people about funding!  
* T-shirt
  - Women to add? Margaret Hamilton, Rosalind Franklin 
  - Anyone from Tucson?
